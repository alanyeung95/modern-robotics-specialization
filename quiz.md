## question

Assume your arm, from your shoulder to your palm, has 7 degrees of freedom. You are carrying a tray like a waiter, and you must keep the tray horizontal to avoid spilling drinks on the tray. How many degrees of freedom does your arm have while satisfying the constraint that the tray stays horizontal? Your answer should be an integer.

## ans (chatgpt)

If your arm has 7 degrees of freedom and you are carrying a tray while keeping it horizontal, several factors come into play:

Translation: Your arm can move in three dimensions (forward/backward, left/right, up/down), which gives 3 degrees of freedom.
Rotation at the shoulder: The shoulder joint allows for two rotational degrees of freedom, typically referred to as pitch and yaw.
Rotation at the elbow: The elbow joint provides one rotational degree of freedom, usually known as flexion or extension.
Wrist rotation: The wrist joint contributes one rotational degree of freedom, often called pronation or supination.
However, when you must keep the tray horizontal, it constrains the wrist rotation to maintain the tray's level position. As a result, the wrist's rotational degree of freedom is eliminated, reducing the total degrees of freedom.

Therefore, with the constraint of keeping the tray horizontal, your arm would have 5 degrees of freedom: 3 for translation, 2 for shoulder rotation (pitch and yaw), while the wrist rotation (pronation/supination) is restricted.
